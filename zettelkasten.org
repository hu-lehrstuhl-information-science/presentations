* Introduction
** Disclaimer: I am not a PIM expert ;)
** /Zettelkasten/ invented by Niklas Luhmann
** Among Weber one of the big German sociologist in the 21st century
** Wrote roughly 60 books in 30 years
** His research assistant:
- Shelves storing 90,000 /Zettel/, i. e. (paper) notes
- *Zettelkasten* as a conversation partner
** COMMENT The idea reminds me of personal wikis and Jesse also compared it with Memex as envisioned by Bush in [[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/]["As we may think"]]
* Aims
** Create a knowledge base, i.e. personal wiki
** Retain knowledge for one's entire life
- Maybe even beyond that: [[https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/inhaltsuebersicht][see here]]
** Connect ideas from different sources
** One's personal research assistant
* How to get there?
** It's a process not a static tool
** Everything on little *linked* notes
** Assign keywords
- Heuristic:

  In which situation do I want to find this note?
** Your own short description
- Ideas should be described in 2-3 sentences
- Copy & paste is discouraged
** Notes/ideas are atomic
- Self-descriptive / autonomous
*** Advantages:
- Freely composable with other ideas
  - /source agnostic/
- Easy to digest
** No hierarchy
- Only local ordering
- In its entirety: a big graph
* Probably life long emerging process
